# New-VSCodePipelineCustomActionType

## SYNOPSIS
Adds an AWS::CodePipeline::CustomActionType resource to the template.
The AWS::CodePipeline::CustomActionType resource creates a custom action for activities that aren't included in the CodePipeline default actions, such as running an internally developed build process or a test suite.
You can use these custom actions in the stage of a pipeline.
For more information, see Create and Add a Custom Action in AWS CodePipeline: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/how-to-create-custom-action.html in the *AWS CodePipeline User Guide*.

## DESCRIPTION
Adds an AWS::CodePipeline::CustomActionType resource to the template.
The AWS::CodePipeline::CustomActionType resource creates a custom action for activities that aren't included in the CodePipeline default actions, such as running an internally developed build process or a test suite.
You can use these custom actions in the stage of a pipeline.

## PARAMETERS

### -LogicalId
The logical ID must be alphanumeric (A-Za-z0-9) and unique within the template.
Use the logical name to reference the resource in other parts of the template.
For example, if you want to map an Amazon Elastic Block Store volume to an Amazon EC2 instance, you reference the logical IDs to associate the block stores with the instance.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Category
The category of the custom action, such as a build action or a test action.
Although Source and Approval are listed as valid values, they are not currently functional.
These values are reserved for future use.

### -ConfigurationProperties
The configuration properties for the custom action.
You can refer to a name in the configuration properties of the custom action within the URL templates by following the format of {Config:name}, as long as the configuration property is both required and not secret.

### -Provider
The provider of the service used in the custom action, such as AWS CodeDeploy.

### -Settings
URLs that provide users information about this custom action.

### -Version
The version identifier of the custom action.

PrimitiveType: String
UpdateType: Immutable

```yaml
Type: Object
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DeletionPolicy
With the DeletionPolicy attribute you can preserve or (in some cases) backup a resource when its stack is deleted.
You specify a DeletionPolicy attribute for each resource that you want to control.
If a resource has no DeletionPolicy attribute, AWS CloudFormation deletes the resource by default.

To keep a resource when its stack is deleted, specify Retain for that resource.
You can use retain for any resource.
For example, you can retain a nested stack, S3 bucket, or EC2 instance so that you can continue to use or modify those resources after you delete their stacks.

You must use one of the following options: "Delete","Retain","Snapshot"

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DependsOn
With the DependsOn attribute you can specify that the creation of a specific resource follows another.
When you add a DependsOn attribute to a resource, that resource is created only after the creation of the resource specified in the DependsOn attribute.

This parameter takes a string or list of strings representing Logical IDs of resources that must be created prior to this resource being created.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Metadata
The Metadata attribute enables you to associate structured data with a resource.
By adding a Metadata attribute to a resource, you can add data in JSON or YAML to the resource declaration.
In addition, you can use intrinsic functions (such as GetAtt and Ref), parameters, and pseudo parameters within the Metadata attribute to add those interpreted values.

You must use a PSCustomObject containing key/value pairs here.
This will be returned when describing the resource using AWS CLI.

```yaml
Type: Object
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -UpdatePolicy
Use the UpdatePolicy attribute to specify how AWS CloudFormation handles updates to the AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup resource.
AWS CloudFormation invokes one of three update policies depending on the type of change you make or whether a scheduled action is associated with the Auto Scaling group.

You must use the "Add-UpdatePolicy" function here.

```yaml
Type: Object
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Condition
Logical ID of the condition that this resource needs to be true in order for this resource to be provisioned.

```yaml
Type: Object
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters
This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable, -InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose, -WarningAction, and -WarningVariable.
