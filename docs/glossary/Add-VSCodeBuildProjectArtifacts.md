## PARAMETERS

### -Path
Along with namespaceType and name, the pattern that AWS CodeBuild uses to name and store the output artifact:
+ If type is set to CODEPIPELINE, AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified.
This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild.
+ If type is set to NO_ARTIFACTS, this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced.
+ If type is set to S3, this is the path to the output artifact.
If path is not specified, path is not used.
For example, if path is set to MyArtifacts, namespaceType is set to NONE, and name is set to MyArtifact.zip, the output artifact is stored in the output bucket at MyArtifacts/MyArtifact.zip.

UpdateType: Mutable

```yaml
Type: Object
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Type
The type of build output artifact.
Valid values include:
+  CODEPIPELINE: The build project has build output generated through AWS CodePipeline.
+  NO_ARTIFACTS: The build project does not produce any build output.
+  S3: The build project stores build output in Amazon Simple Storage Service Amazon S3.

```yaml
Type: Object
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: True

Default value: None

```

### -ArtifactIdentifier
An identifier for this artifact definition.

PrimitiveType: String

```yaml
Type: Object
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: 3
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -OverrideArtifactName
If set to true a name specified in the buildspec file overrides the artifact name.
The name specified in a buildspec file is calculated at build time and uses the Shell command language.
For example, you can append a date and time to your artifact name so that it is always unique.

UpdateType: Mutable

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: 4
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Packaging
The type of build output artifact to create:
+ If type is set to CODEPIPELINE, AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified.
This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output artifacts instead of AWS CodeBuild.
+ If type is set to NO_ARTIFACTS, this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced.
+ If type is set to S3, valid values include:
+  NONE: AWS CodeBuild creates in the output bucket a folder that contains the build output.
This is the default if packaging is not specified.
+  ZIP: AWS CodeBuild creates in the output bucket a ZIP file that contains the build output.

PrimitiveType: String
UpdateType: Mutable

```yaml
Type: Object
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: 5
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -EncryptionDisabled
Set to true if you do not want your output artifacts encrypted.
This option is valid only if your artifacts type is Amazon Simple Storage Service Amazon S3.
If this is set with another artifacts type, an invalidInputException is thrown.

Documentation: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-codebuild-project-artifacts.html#cfn-codebuild-project-artifacts-encryptiondisabled
PrimitiveType: Boolean
UpdateType: Mutable

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: 6
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Location
Information about the build output artifact location:
+ If type is set to CODEPIPELINE, AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified.
This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output locations instead of AWS CodeBuild.
+ If type is set to NO_ARTIFACTS, this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced.
+ If type is set to S3, this is the name of the output bucket.
If you specify CODEPIPELINE or NO_ARTIFACTS for the Type property, don't specify this property.
For all of the other types, you must specify this property.

Documentation: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-codebuild-project-artifacts.html#cfn-codebuild-project-artifacts-location
PrimitiveType: String
UpdateType: Mutable

```yaml
Type: Object
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: 7
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Name
Along with path and namespaceType, the pattern that AWS CodeBuild uses to name and store the output artifact:
+ If type is set to CODEPIPELINE, AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified.
This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild.
+ If type is set to NO_ARTIFACTS, this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced.
+ If type is set to S3, this is the name of the output artifact object.
If you set the name to be a forward slash "/", the artifact is stored in the root of the output bucket.
For example:
+  If path is set to MyArtifacts, namespaceType is set to BUILD_ID, and name is set to MyArtifact.zip, then the output artifact is stored in MyArtifacts/build-ID/MyArtifact.zip.
+  If path is empty, namespaceType is set to NONE, and name is set to "/", the output artifact is stored in the root of the output bucket.
+  If path is set to MyArtifacts, namespaceType is set to BUILD_ID, and name is set to "/", the output artifact is stored in MyArtifacts/build-ID .
If you specify CODEPIPELINE or NO_ARTIFACTS for the Type property, don't specify this property.
For all of the other types, you must specify this property.

UpdateType: Mutable

```yaml
Type: Object
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: 8
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -NamespaceType
Along with path and name, the pattern that AWS CodeBuild uses to determine the name and location to store the output artifact:
+ If type is set to CODEPIPELINE, AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified.
This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild.
+ If type is set to NO_ARTIFACTS, this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced.
+ If type is set to S3, valid values include:
+  BUILD_ID: Include the build ID in the location of the build output artifact.
+  NONE: Do not include the build ID.
This is the default if namespaceType is not specified.
For example, if path is set to MyArtifacts, namespaceType is set to BUILD_ID, and name is set to MyArtifact.zip, the output artifact is stored in MyArtifacts/build-ID/MyArtifact.zip.
