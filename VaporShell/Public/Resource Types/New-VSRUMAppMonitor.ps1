    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Adds an AWS::RUM::AppMonitor resource to the template. Creates a CloudWatch RUM app monitor, which you can use to collect telemetry data from your application and send it to CloudWatch RUM. The data includes performance and reliability information such as page load time, client-side errors, and user behavior.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Adds an AWS::RUM::AppMonitor resource to the template. Creates a CloudWatch RUM app monitor, which you can use to collect telemetry data from your application and send it to CloudWatch RUM. The data includes performance and reliability information such as page load time, client-side errors, and user behavior.

After you create an app monitor, sign in to the CloudWatch RUM console to get the JavaScript code snippet to add to your web application. For more information, see How do I find a code snippet that I've already generated?: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-RUM-find-code-snippet.html

    .PARAMETER LogicalId
        The logical ID must be alphanumeric (A-Za-z0-9) and unique within the template. Use the logical name to reference the resource in other parts of the template. For example, if you want to map an Amazon Elastic Block Store volume to an Amazon EC2 instance, you reference the logical IDs to associate the block stores with the instance.

    .PARAMETER Name
        A name for the app monitor. This parameter is required.

    .PARAMETER Domain
        The top-level internet domain name for which your application has administrative authority. This parameter is required.

    .PARAMETER CwLogEnabled
        Data collected by CloudWatch RUM is kept by RUM for 30 days and then deleted. This parameter specifies whether CloudWatch RUM sends a copy of this telemetry data to Amazon CloudWatch Logs in your account. This enables you to keep the telemetry data for more than 30 days, but it does incur Amazon CloudWatch Logs charges.
If you omit this parameter, the default is false.

    .PARAMETER Tags
        Assigns one or more tags key-value pairs to the app monitor.
Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions by granting a user permission to access or change only resources with certain tag values.
Tags don't have any semantic meaning to AWS and are interpreted strictly as strings of characters.
You can associate as many as 50 tags with an app monitor.
For more information, see Tagging AWS resources: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html.

        UpdateType: Mutable
        Type: List
        ItemType: Tag
        DuplicatesAllowed: False

    .PARAMETER AppMonitorConfiguration
        A structure that contains much of the configuration data for the app monitor. If you are using Amazon Cognito for authorization, you must include this structure in your request, and it must include the ID of the Amazon Cognito identity pool to use for authorization. If you don't include AppMonitorConfiguration, you must set up your own authorization method. For more information, see Authorize your application to send data to AWS: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-RUM-get-started-authorization.html.
If you omit this argument, the sample rate used for CloudWatch RUM is set to 10% of the user sessions.

    .PARAMETER DeletionPolicy
        With the DeletionPolicy attribute you can preserve or (in some cases) backup a resource when its stack is deleted. You specify a DeletionPolicy attribute for each resource that you want to control. If a resource has no DeletionPolicy attribute, AWS CloudFormation deletes the resource by default.

        To keep a resource when its stack is deleted, specify Retain for that resource. You can use retain for any resource. For example, you can retain a nested stack, S3 bucket, or EC2 instance so that you can continue to use or modify those resources after you delete their stacks.

        You must use one of the following options: "Delete","Retain","Snapshot"

    .PARAMETER UpdateReplacePolicy
        Use the UpdateReplacePolicy attribute to retain or (in some cases) backup the existing physical instance of a resource when it is replaced during a stack update operation.

        When you initiate a stack update, AWS CloudFormation updates resources based on differences between what you submit and the stack's current template and parameters. If you update a resource property that requires that the resource be replaced, AWS CloudFormation recreates the resource during the update. Recreating the resource generates a new physical ID. AWS CloudFormation creates the replacement resource first, and then changes references from other dependent resources to point to the replacement resource. By default, AWS CloudFormation then deletes the old resource. Using the UpdateReplacePolicy, you can specify that AWS CloudFormation retain or (in some cases) create a snapshot of the old resource.

        For resources that support snapshots, such as AWS::EC2::Volume, specify Snapshot to have AWS CloudFormation create a snapshot before deleting the old resource instance.

        You can apply the UpdateReplacePolicy attribute to any resource. UpdateReplacePolicy is only executed if you update a resource property whose update behavior is specified as Replacement, thereby causing AWS CloudFormation to replace the old resource with a new one with a new physical ID. For example, if you update the Engine property of an AWS::RDS::DBInstance resource type, AWS CloudFormation creates a new resource and replaces the current DB instance resource with the new one. The UpdateReplacePolicy attribute would then dictate whether AWS CloudFormation deleted, retained, or created a snapshot of the old DB instance. The update behavior for each property of a resource is specified in the reference topic for that resource in the AWS Resource and Property Types Reference. For more information on resource update behavior, see Update Behaviors of Stack Resources.

        The UpdateReplacePolicy attribute applies to stack updates you perform directly, as well as stack updates performed using change sets.

        Note
        Resources that are retained continue to exist and continue to incur applicable charges until you delete those resources. Snapshots that are created with this policy continue to exist and continue to incur applicable charges until you delete those snapshots. UpdateReplacePolicy retains the old physical resource or snapshot, but removes it from AWS CloudFormation's scope.

        UpdateReplacePolicy differs from the DeletionPolicy attribute in that it only applies to resources replaced during stack updates. Use DeletionPolicy for resources deleted when a stack is deleted, or when the resource definition itself is deleted from the template as part of a stack update.

        You must use one of the following options: "Delete","Retain","Snapshot"

    .PARAMETER DependsOn
        With the DependsOn attribute you can specify that the creation of a specific resource follows another. When you add a DependsOn attribute to a resource, that resource is created only after the creation of the resource specified in the DependsOn attribute.

        This parameter takes a string or list of strings representing Logical IDs of resources that must be created prior to this resource being created.


    .PARAMETER Metadata
        The Metadata attribute enables you to associate structured data with a resource. By adding a Metadata attribute to a resource, you can add data in JSON or YAML to the resource declaration. In addition, you can use intrinsic functions (such as GetAtt and Ref), parameters, and pseudo parameters within the Metadata attribute to add those interpreted values.

        You must use a PSCustomObject containing key/value pairs here. This will be returned when describing the resource using AWS CLI.


    .PARAMETER UpdatePolicy
        Use the UpdatePolicy attribute to specify how AWS CloudFormation handles updates to the AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup resource. AWS CloudFormation invokes one of three update policies depending on the type of change you make or whether a scheduled action is associated with the Auto Scaling group.

        You must use the "Add-UpdatePolicy" function here.
    .PARAMETER Condition
        Logical ID of the condition that this resource needs to be true in order for this resource to be provisioned.
